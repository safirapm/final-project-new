          <p>
            Foodieasy is the most trusted cooking brand in the world. The
            longtime home to the Bon App√©tit and Gourmet recipe archives,
            Epicurious has grown to include original recipes from the Epicurious
            Test Kitchen, daily advice from the cooking-savvy Epicurious staff,
            and some of the fastest-growing food video series on YouTube. What
            started in 1995 as a website is now also an iOS app, a vibrant
            YouTube channel, a series of newsletters, a Facebook Group and, in
            2018, a book ("COOK90: The 30-Day Plan for Faster, Healthier,
            Happier Meals").
